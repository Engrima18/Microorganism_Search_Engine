# Microorganism_Search_Engine

Final project for the "Cloud Computing" course at La Sapienza University of Rome.

## Brief description

The goal of this project is to develop an application that provides a search engine for images of bacteria. The search engine should be able to retrieve the most similar images to a given query image, uploaded by the user. The project will be deployed on Amazon Web Services and the ”algorithmic part” to compute similarity among
images will be done using Weaviate.
